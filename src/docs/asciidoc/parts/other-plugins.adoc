== Compatibility with Other Plugins

=== License plugin

The https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin[License plugin] is a really useful plugin to help with
maintenance of license headers in source code. One standard feature of this plugin is to scan all source sets
for license governance. Unfortunately this detects the source sets that are added by `GradleTest` itself which has
its own internally generated license headers.

There is an https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin/issues/115[open issue] against this,
but for now the best workaround is to exclude the test code generated by `GradleTest`.

.Configuring licence plugin for exclusion
[source,groovy]
----
license {
  exclude '**/*CompatibilitySpec.groovy'
}

=== CodeNarc plugin

When adding GradleTest to a project that also has codenarc configured, the tests generated by GradleTest will be scanned by CodeNarc.

.Configuring CodeNarc to ignore GradleTest
[source,groovy]
----
codenarcGradleTest.enabled = false
