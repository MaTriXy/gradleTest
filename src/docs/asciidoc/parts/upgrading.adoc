== Upgrading from v0.5.x

`%%.VERSION%%` is no longer supported when building with Gradle 2.13+ and builds will fail with
`Could not find foo:bar:%%VERSION%%`` error if encountered.
It will still be supported if using Gradle 2.12 or earlier as legacy mode will be invoked.
Even under legacy mode it's use is no longer required. Simply remove the classpath, and if
you don't anything extra in the `buildscript` block, the whole of the `buildscript` block.

For instance the following block can be complety removed:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.jruby-gradle:jruby-gradle-plugin:%%VERSION%%'
    }
}
----
