= GradleRunner (Gradle 2.14.1+)

The `org.ysb33r.gradlerunner` plugin adds a default task called `gradleRunner` which is of type `GradleRunnerSteps`. This task allows people to run specific Gradle steps interlevaed via other actions such as copying files. This is specifically useful for people who need to document development steps where Gradle is involved.

== Steps

Steps are added via the `step` keyword. Each step has a name which can later be used to extract information after execution.

[source,groovy]
----
gradleRunner {
  step 'a simple closure', {  // <1>
    new File(workingDir,'build.gradle').text = '/* empty build file */'
    new File(reportsDir,'foo.txt').txt = 'output to report directory'  // <2>
  }

  step 'running gradle', 'tasks', '--all' // <3>

  failingStep 'this gradle will fail', 'non-existing-task' // <4>
}
----
<1> A step can be a closure or an `Action`.
<2> Every step will have an unique directory for dropping files,
<3> A step can be a Gradle execution. Supply all command-line parameters after the name. A Gradle execution will drop `out.txt` and `err.txt` in the report directory.
<4> A step can also be a Gradle execution that is known to fail.

After execution use `gradleRunner.getStepReportDir(STEP_NAME)` to obtain the reporting directory for a step.
