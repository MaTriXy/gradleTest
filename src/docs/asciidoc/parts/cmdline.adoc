== Command-line Awareness

GradleTest is aware of certain command-line parameters and will pass them on to running tests.

* `--rerun-tasks` - All tests will be re-run even if they were previsouly successful.
* `--offline` - No dependency checks will be performed and if plugins implements any offline behaviour this will automatically be enabled.
