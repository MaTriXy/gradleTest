== Command-line Awareness

=== Gradle standard options

GradleTest is aware of certain command-line parameters and will pass them on to running tests.

* `--rerun-tasks` - All tests will be re-run even if they were previsouly successful.
* `--offline` - No dependency checks will be performed and if plugins implements any offline behaviour this will automatically be enabled.

=== Temporarily overriding Gradle versions

It is very convenient to sometimes to runs the test with a subset of the versions specified in the configuration. This is
achievable by passing a system property to Gradle

[source,bash]
----
-DgradleTest.versions=3.5,4.4.1 <1> <2>
----
<1> If more than one GradleTest task is defined, replace `gradleTest` with the name of the appropriate GradleTest task.
<2> List the versions in a commma-separated list. No validation is done on the string. If it leads to invalid Gradle
  versions the build will fail.
