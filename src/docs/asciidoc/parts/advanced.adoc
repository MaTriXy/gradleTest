=== Overriding dependencies

GradleTest uses Spock Framework, JUnit & Apache Commons IO underneath. If, for some reason you need to override the
versions of these dependencies it can be done in the `gradleTestCompile` configuration. If you created a new `GradleTest`
task called `foobar` then the appropriate configuration will be callled `foobarCompile`.
