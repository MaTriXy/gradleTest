== Awesomeness

This plugin is so awesome, it applies to itself and then runs a collection of tests.

In v0.5.5 this was handled through the self-referencing plugin recipe - See `gradle/self-reference.gradle` in
an old codebase.

Since 1.0, the complexities required more than the above could handle and the same is noe achived via a
https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] task. See
`gradle/compatibility-tests.gradle` in an up to date codebase on how this is done.
