Test your plugin against different versions of Gradle as part of your build. This plugin extends the power that the new
https://docs.gradle.org/2.13/userguide/test_kit.html[GradleTestKit] brings without having to actually author code. It rather allows plugins authors to write functional tests
that looks like normal Gradle projects (multi-project is supported). This also makes it easier to create sample projects
that can directly be used in documentation.

NOTE: *If you are using a Gradle version < 3.0, you will need to use a version of thisplugin before 2.0*.
