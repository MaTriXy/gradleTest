= GradleTest Gradle Plugin
:toc:

Test your plugin against different versions of Gradle as part of your build. This plugin extends the power that the new
`GradleTestKit` brings without having to actually author code. It rather allows plugins authors to write functional tests
that looks like normal Gradle projects (multi-project is supported). This also makes it easier to create sample projects
that can directly be used in documentation.

NOTE: *If you are using a Gradle version < 2.13, it will run in legacy mode and behave like the 0.5.5 version of the plugin*.
